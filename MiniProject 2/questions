1.1a
What differences do you see between the pmf plotted in part 1 above and the
estimated pdf?

What differences do you see as the sample sizes increase from 70 to 30000?
  With more samples, the curve becomes smoother and begins to looks more distinctly Gaussian.

1.1b
1. Explain why tabulate(X) gives a pdf while the other gives a pmf.
  Tabulate(X) makes the time into discrete values, but without the floor function, time is continuous and therefore easier displayed in a pdf.
2. What difference do you find for the derived min, max for each distribution?
3. Can you relate the difference to identify a distinct characteristics of a pdf?


1.2c
What differences do you see between the distribution generated in this task
and the plot from Task 1.1 for 30K sample size?

1.2d
What differences do you see compared to the values of a and b in Task 1.1?
The value for A is slightly higher, and the value for B is lower in this task. 
This could be due to random generation, especially since samples are more sparse in the very outer edges of a Gaussian distribution.
